# Steel--Defect-Detection

The steel industry faces a significant challenge in classifying steel sheets, which is currently done manually at a considerable cost. To address this issue, we are developing a solution that leverages image analysis techniques to automatically classify steel sheets based on their visual attributes.

The main objective of this classification project is to classify the steel sheets images in to defective and un-defective classes. 

For image processing:Sklearn,Keras,Numpy,TensorFlow library are used.
• Used CNN architecture - ResNet50 and Sequential CNN Keras models with pre trained weights on ImageNet and fine tuned end layers on dataset.
• Compared performance of ResNet50 and Sequential CNN Keras model on Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Validation loss.
